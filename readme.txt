	What is it about?
This is a text adventure game that tests the players logical thinking.
You play as a politician who said something very stupid... Not too bad.
But you have to stick with it, if you contradict yourself, you loose.

	What is next?
- One question needs to be changed for clarity
- Some small feature changes
